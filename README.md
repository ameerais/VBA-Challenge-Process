Single Quarter Stock Analysis automates the analysis of stock data within a single worksheet for a given quarter. The script reads stock data, calculates key financial metrics such as the quarterly change, percentage change, and total volume for each stock ticker, and outputs these results into a summary table. Users are then easily able to assess the performance of various stocks. The script applies conditional formatting to the results, highlighting positive changes in green and negative changes in red. 

Multiple Year Stock Analysis script extends the functionality of the Single Quarter Stock Analysis by processing stock data across multiple worksheets, each representing different quarters or years. This script iterates through each worksheet in the Excel workbook, performing the same calculations as the single quarter script but on a larger, multi-period dataset. 

By identifying the stocks with the greatest percentage increases, decreases, and total volumes, the scripts provided crucial insights into stock performance.
